# LanguageProject
I started this project at the beginning of my Senior year of high school, when I was just starting to learn C++.  As one might expect, I didn't know what I was doing, so a significant amount of the code in this repository is or will be refactored and rebuilt.

#### The Project
I have been interested in figuring out how programming languages work.  One of the things that I have been specifically interested in was how the compiler worked.  I also wanted to learn about assembly languages.  I started this because of an article series that I found that provided an overview of the structure of a compiler.

My work on this project has been pretty scattered (at the time of writing this, there are commits to master on only 10 different days spread across 3 years).
