# LanguageProject
Me attempting to build a compiler in a language that I'm only recently learning 'cause I'm dumb

#### The Project
I have been interested in figuring out how programming languages work.  One of the things that I have been specifically interested in was how the compiler worked.  I also wanted to learn about low-level languages, such as Assembly.  I started this because of an article series that I found that provided an overview of the structure of a compiler.
